There is an auction for every items -> use item's identifier to refer to its auction.
Build a Auction Sniper as Java Swing app to bid multiple items at a time.
It show the identifier, stop price, current price and status of each item it's snipping.
Buyer can add new items for snipping.
It can dsplay values with change when events arriving from the action house.

XMPP is used as underlying communication layer. It's a protocol for streaming XML elements across the network.
The bidder can send commands, which are: 
+ Join: wanna join a auction, the sender of XMPP message identifies bidder and name of the chat session identifies the item 
+ Bid: send a bidding price to the auction
An Auction sends events, which are:
+ Price: report current accepted price, minimum increment for the next bid and name of bidder who bid that price.
Send to a bidder when it first jon and to all bidders whenever a new bid has been accepted.
+ Close: auction is closed. Winner of the last price event has won.

XMPP message format:
Single line with name/value pairs separated by semi-colon, name and value separated by colon.

Choosing an XMPP message broker:
To let the application talk to stub auction house. Openfire and its client library Smack seem to be good.

Choosing high-level test framework can work with Swing and Smack:
Both of them are multithreaded and event-driven. Luckily, there is WindowLicker, an open-source software, that can help us.
